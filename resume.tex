\textit{Undergraduate Research Assistant} \hfill August 2022 -- May 2024
\vspace{-0.5em}
   \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep -5pt {} 
      \item Trained and tested a deep RL model on the AWS DeepRacer stack for autonomous vehicle pathing with camera input
      \item Created an architecture-agnostic fault injection and resilience framework in TensorFlow
      for any black-box neural network
   \end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\textbf{Georgia Tech Research Institute} \hfill Atlanta, GA\\
\textit{Student Research Assistant (TMPO Lab, CIPHER)} \hfill May 2021 -- May 2024
\vspace{-0.5em}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -5pt {} 
     \item Designed and implemented the first real-time operating system in Rust for the ARM Cortex R4 where
     nearly 100\% of Rust's safety features at abstraction levels above the bootloader were utilized to improve
     upon the critical safety of the system
     \item Worked on various FPGA projects related to architecture analysis and bitstream generation (secret clearance)
 \end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\textit{Research Intern (ATAS)} \hfill June -- July 2020
\vspace{-0.5em}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -5pt {} 
     \item Worked and modeled a 5 degree-of-freedom Arduino-powered arm and
     developed a C++ library for the arm's inverse kinematics
     \item Researched various OpenCV-extendable libraries such as AprilTags for detecting visual orientation of the end effector
 \end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\textit{Research Intern (ATAS)} \hfill June -- July 2019
\vspace{-0.5em}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -5pt {} 
     \item Improved the design of the battery compartments in the Kennedy Space Center piezoelectric tiles
     to prevent expansion over time by replacing the neoprene casing with a material that does not absorb and retain
     heat
     \item Developed and presented a liquid waste treament method for the Gates Foundation Reinvented Toilet
     involving a multi-stage filter and UV-C LED disinfectant system that would have a 99.9\% success rate
     at producing safe drinking water
