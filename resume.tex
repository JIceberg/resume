\vspace{-1.25em}
\item \textbf{Neuraphonic} (HackGT X) | \textit{Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Google Cloud, Twilio, MATLAB} \\
Developed a diagnostic assistant for Parkinson's disease utilizing a vision transformer and signal processing techniques to extract
various features from audio samples uploaded to a website hosted on Google Cloud or through telephone. Won 2nd place best overall project
out of 189 total teams.
\vspace{-0.5em}
\item \textbf{National Characteristics Search} (Capstone Project) | \textit{Python, SQLite}\\
Produced a stand-alone application in Python that accesses characteristic data (such as total population, median income, etc.)
from the U.S. Census in a way that enables quick and easy access and saves that data to a local database using
SQLite. Created in partnership with the Emory University School of Medicine for research into the correlation between
neighborhood characteristics and the development of schizophrenia.
